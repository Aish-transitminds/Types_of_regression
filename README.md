## 🧠 Models Implemented

| Model                     | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Linear Regression**     | Simple baseline model that fits a straight line               |
| **Polynomial Regression** | Captures non-linear patterns by transforming input features   |
| **Ridge Regression**      | L2 regularization to reduce overfitting                       |
| **Lasso Regression**      | L1 regularization for feature selection                       |
| **ElasticNet Regression** | Combines L1 and L2 for balanced regularization                |
| **Decision Tree**         | Tree-based model to capture splits and non-linearity          |
| **Random Forest**         | Ensemble of trees to boost performance and reduce overfitting |
| **Gradient Boosting** 🔥  | (Optional) Boosted ensemble for top-tier accuracy             |

## 🗃️ Dataset

We use the built-in **California Housing Dataset**, which includes:

* 📍 **Location**: Latitude, Longitude
* 👥 **Demographics**: Population, Households, Median Income
* 🏡 **Housing Features**: Age, Rooms per Household
* 🎯 **Target**: Median House Value

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

Each model includes:

* ✅ **Actual vs Predicted Plot**
* 📉 **Residual Distribution**
* 🧮 **Feature Importance** (if supported)

Styled using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for clarity and aesthetics.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the notebook.
2. Ensure the files below are in the same directory:

   * `california_processed.csv`
   * `california_target.csv`
3. Open the notebook in **JupyterLab** or **Google Colab**.
4. Run each section to preprocess, train, and evaluate models.

---

## 🧰 Dependencies

Install all required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

---

## 💡 Insights & Observations

* 🔹 **Median Income** is the most impactful feature across most models.
* 🔹 **Linear models** underperform on complex/non-linear patterns.
* 🔹 **Ensemble methods** like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting outperform basic regressors.
* 🔹 **Lasso** effectively performs feature selection by zeroing irrelevant coefficients.

## 🛠️ Customization Tips

Want to use this for your own dataset? Easy!

1. Replace the data loading section with your own CSV/data source.
2. Use the existing preprocessing pipeline to scale/encode.
3. Plug in your features to the model training blocks.
4. Adjust visualizations and evaluation metrics accordingly.

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

* 🔍 Add **cross-validation** for hyperparameter tuning
* 🧠 Integrate **XGBoost**, **CatBoost**, **LightGBM**
* 📈 Use **SHAP** or **permutation importance** for explainability
* 🗺️ Build a **dashboard** using Streamlit or Gradio
* 🌐 **Deploy** as a web service for real-time inference
